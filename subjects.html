          At STEAM Academy, our courses and subject matter will provide our
          students a cohesive, interdisciplinary educational experience. As a
          STEAM-centric school, we will give our students the opportunity to
          delve into all aspects of their education, while at the same time
          integrating literacy and social students course work into all areas of
          study.

          <p>
            As our students progress through the school, our science curriculum
            will help them to understand of the physical and natural world in
            which they live. From the earth underneath their feet to the stars
            above their heads, our instruction will help them to appreciate and
            respect all that is around them.

          <p>
            In an ever-changing technological landscape, it is important that
            our students are able to understand and utilize all forms of
            technology. Basic computer coding and mechanics are just some of the
            topics that will be introduced to our students through both virtual
            instruction and hands-on application.

          <p>
            Our classes will introduce our students to concepts and challenges
            in many aspects of the engineering spectrum. Lessons in biomedical
            engineering will combine aspects of biology and medicine, while an
            introduction to computer engineering will develop basic computer
            coding skills.

            In the movement from STEM to STEAM, the importance of the rts
            cannot be understated in the development of a well-rounded student.
            Whether through visual arts, performing arts or culinary arts, we
            will lead our students in creative adventures that will stimulate
            the mind and extend their boundaries.

          <p>
            Throughout all aspects of science is the basic need for math. Our
            unique blend of one-on-one instruction and practice exercises will
            help to make math an enjoyable and rewarding challenge for our
            students and set them up for the future.
